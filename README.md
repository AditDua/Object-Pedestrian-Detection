#Object Detection

This project focuses on real-time pedestrian detection using advanced object detection techniques. Designed to enhance safety in environments such as autonomous driving and surveillance, the system identifies pedestrians and triggers alerts when they come within a predefined range. By utilizing deep learning models like YOLO, the system ensures accurate and efficient detection, with configurable settings for detection thresholds and alert distances. The project offers a practical solution for monitoring and responding to pedestrian proximity, contributing to safer and more responsive systems.

How It Works
Video Input: The system captures video from a camera or a video file.
Object Detection: Each frame is processed using a pre-trained deep learning model to identify pedestrians.
Distance Calculation: The distance to each detected pedestrian is calculated based on their position in the frame.
Alert Generation: If the distance to a pedestrian falls below the configured threshold, an alert is generated, which can be a sound notification, visual cue, or log entry.
Visualization: Detected pedestrians are highlighted on the screen, and alerts are displayed.
